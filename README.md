```
$ npm install && cd react-native && npm install
$ shadow-cljs watch app

;; wait for first compile to finish or metro gets confused
$ cd react-native

$ npm start
;; and
$ react-native run-android

;; production build
$ shadow-cljs release app

;; no clue what to do for react-native
```

## Notes

The `react-native` folder was generated by calling `react-native init AwesomeProject` and renaming the folder.

The `:app` build will create an `react-native/app/index.js`. In `release` mode that is the only file needed. In dev mode the `app` directory will contain many more `.js` files.

`:init-fn` is called after all files are loaded and in the case of `expo` must render something synchronously as it will otherwise complain about a missing root component.

`reagent.core` loads `reagent.dom` which will load `react-dom` which we don't have or need. Including the `src/main/reagent/dom.cljs` to create an empty shell. Copied from [re-natal](https://github.com/drapanjanas/re-natal/blob/master/resources/cljs-reagent6/reagent_dom.cljs).
